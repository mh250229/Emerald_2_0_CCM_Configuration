These articles describe how to configure features end to end, i.e., are dependent on multiple features.  
Features can be configured via the CCM UI or the Emerald 2.0 Services.  
* Each CCM UI process is documented in its own section in the relevant module based on the menu in the CCM application.  
* All Emerald servicesâ€™ processes are documented in DEVEX.

To configure a feature end to end, a feature may require performing steps in more than one module in the CCM UI, and/or via the Services.  
Each article provides the processes required to fully configure the feature, which should then be available on the touchpoint.  
Each step in the processes is based on out of the box base configuration, unless specified.  
In cases where the step is documented in its relevant module in the CCM UI articles, a link is provided to the relevant article.
