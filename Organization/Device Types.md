# Device Types

**Device Types** categorize Devices according to types. Each Device Type includes the device error codes and the methods used to handle the alert.  

Once the Device Type is linked to a Device, the defined attributes are automatically applied to the Device.  

This enables retailers to apply the relevant alerts to similar type Devices without configuring the alerts for each specific Device.

## Configuring Device Types

1. Browse to Touchpoints/Device Types.  
2. Click **+Add Device Type**.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the device type, for example, Scale.  
4. Click the **+ Add Error**.  
5. In the **Enter Error Code** field, enter the numerical code applied to the specific hardware issue, e.g., Error Code 1234 may indicate a scale communication error.  
6. Select the **Allow Duplicate** checkbox to indicate that an alert is raised even though the same alert was previously displayed and not yet resolved.  
7. From the **Closing Method** drop-down list, select Manual to indicate that the error must be manually closed once the error is resolved.  
8. Click **Save**.
