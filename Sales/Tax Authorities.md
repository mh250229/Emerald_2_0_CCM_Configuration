## Tax

Different taxes are imposed by authorities in a specific jurisdiction. Multiple tax rates are applied based on the Tax Authorities such as: state, county, city, region, district, etc.  
Each new tax rate can be defined as a specific tax type, such as Tax (regular taxes), Item fee or Transaction fee. Fees are defined by the authority, such as recycling, 911 fees, etc.  
Each tax rate for any type can be defined with different conditions, such as tax according to location, etc. Taxes can be based on a defined method, for example, a fixed tax rate, percentage of the item price.  You can specify that a tax can be exempt, discounted, etc.
