## Touchpoint Parameters 

**Touchpoint Parameters** is used to configure the number of minutes of inactivity after which the session expires, and the POS is automatically locked. Once the POS is locked, the cashier is required to log in again with their user and password.

Different thresholds can be configured for different Touchpoint Groups. However, only one threshold or exception can be configured for a specific Touchpoint Group.
