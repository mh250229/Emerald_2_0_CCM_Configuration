# Touchpoints

This module is currently not in use from the CCM UI.  

Touchpoints is used to define touchpoints and connect them to a specific Touchpoint Group. A Touchpoint can be any client, e.g., a POS Terminal, Fuel POS, etc.  

You can define as many Touchpoints as required and connect them to a specific Touchpoint Group. Devices are linked to Touchpoints, for example, a printer, PIN pad, POS display, drawer and scale device can be linked to the POS touchpoint.  

On loading a touchpoint for the first time it must always be registered.
