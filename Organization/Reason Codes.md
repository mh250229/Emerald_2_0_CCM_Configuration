# Reason Codes

**Reason Codes** define the reason codes selected when an activity is performed on the touchpoints and indicate the reason the activity was performed.

For example, when the cashier performs a Price Override, the system prompts the cashier to enter the reason the item price was overridden.  
Reason Codes are not defined for specific Locations.
