## PLU Menus

**PLU Menus** are used to build a menu of PLU Groups. PLU menus define the PLU Groups displayed at the touchpoints in the store.  

In addition, you can specify how the PLU Group items are displayed in the menu. You can define the number of items per column in the menu, as well as display the items in alphabetical order, or in the order the items are added to the PLU Group.  

PLU Groups must be set up before you can define a PLU Menu.
