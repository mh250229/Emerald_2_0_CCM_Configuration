# Touchpoint Applications

**Touchpoint Applications** display the types of touchpoints configured in the system and the application which supports each touchpoint.  
In an NCR Emerald deployment, there are different kinds of applications that access the system, e.g., POS terminals, android client, IOS client, office client, Touch POS, Fuel Client, etc.  
Each application has a set of specific settings that are required in order to function properly. The settings include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Screen Layout configuration
* Menu configuration  

The Touchpoint Application option enables the server to define and save these settings, which can then be used by the different applications that require these settings.
