# Culture/Messages

**Messages** are displayed at the POS terminal when a business event is triggered.  

Messages are configured in the module for which you require the message.  For example, messages that are displayed when a business rule is triggered are created in the Business Rule module.

For details on creating Messages, see Messages.
