## Currency

**Currencies** define the cash tender according to predefined denominations. Denominations for each currency include notes, coins, or rolls of coins. The breakdown for the denomination types are the amounts, for example, 100, 50, 20, dollar notes, etc., filtering down to the coins. Users can specify the denomination amount and type for each currency.

Both local and foreign currencies can be defined.

**Note:** Denominations are not yet supported in this version.
