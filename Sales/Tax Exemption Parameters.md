### Tax Exemption Parameters

**Tax Exemption Parameters** determine if the customer’s tax exemption ID and/or name is required when exempting tax in a sales transaction. Tax Exemptions are available for eligible institutes (church) or individuals (diplomats).

When configured, on exempting a tax, the system prompts for customer’s Tax Exempt ID. The cashier enters the customer’s Tax Exempt ID, and if configured enters the customer’s name.
