# Stores

This module is Read Only.

Stores are used by Retailers to define their Business Units.  
Stores are created and updated by the NEP Sites APIs/application and not on the CCM. Users can only updated the store Fax number ad Bank Account on the CCM.  

A Business Unit is a parent level in the Store Hierarchy which groups stores. Stores can be grouped by region. A Business Unit of a store can either be the store hierarchy or a category in the store hierarchy depending on the configured system environment.

Once a Store is set up, it can be linked to a Store hierarchy, which enables you to add the store to a specific group within a chain of stores. The hierarchy is the classification of a group of Stores according to your store's policy. Some may define the hierarchy according to the storesâ€™ zone, or maybe size.  

In addition, you can link stores to touchpoint groups. This enables you to specify that a touch point group for example, ExpressPOS is part of a defined store.
