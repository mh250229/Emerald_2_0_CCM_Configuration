### Tax Brackets

**Tax Brackets** tables are defined according to Tax Authority regulations and contain the price increments between each cent increase in tax. Tax Brackets serve as cutoff levels for sales tax rates and are required by regulation in certain US States.

The tables are used when tax is calculated using the Tax Brackets method, in which different tax rates are applied as the item price progressively increases.

Since not all Tax Authorities implement Tax Brackets, an extension must be installed for each region using Tax Brackets.
